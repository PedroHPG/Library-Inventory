# Library-Inventory

PLANS:
We'll need a database, of course. That's...half the point.
We want a system to take care of books, which are currently borrowed or in stock.
So obviously we'll need a Book class, with a title, id, author and status.
Keeping in mind that we can have multiple copies of the same book, too.
A way to search this will be nice too, but that's really simple once the database is going.
And perhaps this time we *should* have a user interface.

TODO:
1: Create Book class
2: Create database to store the books in. Only one table is fine
3: Make all the CRUD to interact with that database
4: UI?
